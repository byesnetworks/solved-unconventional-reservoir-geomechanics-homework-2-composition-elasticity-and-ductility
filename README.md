<h1>Instructions</h1>

This assignment focuses on understanding the relationships between the composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of unconventional reservoir rocks.

<h1>Part 1: Composition, microstructure, and elastic properties</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Reading ternary diagrams. For each of samples plotted in Figure 1, determine the percentage by weight of each components (clay + TOC, QFP, carbonates).</li>

 <li>Estimate the density for each sample. Using the component densities provided in Table 1 and the wt% values from (a) to calculate an approximate density for each sample.</li>

 <li>Calculate elastic moduli. Ultrasonic laboratory measurements indicate that the compressional wave velocities of the Eagle Ford and Barnett sample are 6.0 and 5.0 km/s, and the shear wave velocities are 3.3 and 3.2 km/s. Using the densities determined in (b), calculate the bulk and shear moduli.</li>

 <li>Calculate effective elastic moduli. The effective modulus can be calculated by summing the contributions from the individual component moduli, where <em>M<sub>i </sub></em>and <em>f<sub>i </sub></em>are the modulus and the fraction of the <em>i</em>th component, and <em>M<sub>eff </sub></em>is the effective modulus of the composite:</li>

</ol>

<em>M<sub>eff </sub></em>= <sup>X</sup><em>f<sub>i</sub>M<sub>i                       </sub></em>(Iso-strain)

(Iso-stress)

<ol>

 <li>Compare your answers for (c) and (d). Do the ultrasonic measurements reflect stiffness components parallel or perpendicular to bedding?</li>

</ol>

<h1>Part 2: Hydraulic fracture propagation in layered media</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Net pressure required for hydraulic fracture propagation. Use the expression for the critical stress intensity factor for mode I cracks (<em>K<sub>IC</sub></em>) to determine the net pressure (<em>P </em>−<em>S</em><sub>3</sub>) required to propagate a hydraulic fracture as a function of length (<em>l</em>). Perform the calculation for each layer using the <em>K<sub>IC </sub></em>values in the table and plot results on the same axes.</li>

</ol>

√

<em>K<sub>IC </sub></em>= (<em>P </em>− <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>)<em>π l</em>

<ol>

 <li>Compare the net pressure values in each layer for a fracture of length <em>l </em>= 3 ft. How important is rock tensile strength to hydraulic fracture propagation once fractures begin to propagate?</li>

 <li>Consider the stress profile in Figure 3. If we apply sufficient pressure to propagate a hydraulic fracture of length <em>l </em>= 1 ft in layer 3, would we expect the fracture to grow vertically into any of the surrounding layers? Which ones and why?</li>

</ol>
